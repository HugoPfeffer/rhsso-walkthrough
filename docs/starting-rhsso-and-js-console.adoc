You can run Red Hat SSO locally or using containers on Openshift. Choose one of the option below.

NOTE: If you have any doubt about which option to choose, talk to your instructor.

== Option 1: Locally

* Execute *docker pull* to download both **Red Hat Single Sign On** and **JS Console:**

----
  docker pull viniciusmartinez/rhsso73:1.0
  docker pull luszczynski/sso-console-app:1.0
----

* Bootstrap both **Red Hat Single Sign ON** and **JS Console:**

----
  docker run -it -p 8080:8080 viniciusmartinez/rhsso73:1.0
  docker run -it -p 80:80 luszczynski/sso-console-app:1.0
----

* if you modify **Red Hat Single Sign On** default port don't forget to update *keycloak.json;*
* Open a browser of your choice and try to access **Red Hat Single Sign On** on the following address with *admin/admin* credentials: http://localhost:8080/auth
* Open a new tab and try to access **JS Console** on the following address: http://localhost:80

== Option 2: Openshift (Recommended)

First, we need to login on Openshift.

{{ OPENSHIFT_MASTER_URL }}[Openshift Web Console,window="_blank"]

* Username: {{ USER_ID }}
* Password: `openshift`

Make sure you are in the `Developer perspective` and in the namespace `ssoXX`.

=== Deploy SSO

* Click on `+Add` -> `From Catalog`

image::2020-05-27-17-45-54.png[]

* Search for `sso` in the filter field and select `Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 (Ephemeral)`

image::1-6-2020-15-03-21-PM.png[]

* Click on `Instantiate Template`

image::2020-05-27-17-56-28.png[]

* Leave the fields as they are and just change `RH-SSO Administrator Username` and `RH-SSO Administrator Password` to `admin`.

image::2020-05-27-17-57-10.png[]

* Click on `Create` at the bottom of the page

image::4-5-2020-14-56-26-PM.png[]

* Wait while Openshift pull the necessary images for Red Hat SSO. When it has finished, you'll see the following screen

=== Deploy js-console

* On the left menu, click on `+Add` -> `Container Image`

image::2020-05-27-18-00-20.png[]

* Use `docker.io/luszczynski/rhsso-js-console-app:1.0` in the `Image name from external registry` field
* Application Name: `redhat-sso`
* Name: `js-console`

image::2020-05-27-18-03-23.png[]

* Now click on `Create`
* Click on the SSO circle and then on the resources tab, copy the Route URL

image::2020-05-27-18-07-42.png[]

* Open the js-console Deployment by clicking on the `js-console` in the upper right corner

image::2020-05-27-18-09-38.png[]

* Now select the `Environment` tab and create a new env `AUTH_SERVER_URL` and fill the value field with the content of the URL of SSO (it's probably in your clipboard)
* Append `/auth` to the end of the url. Now click on `Save`

WARNING: Do not forget to append `auth` at the end of the URL

image::2020-05-27-18-12-51.png[]

* Switch back to the topology view

image::4-5-2020-15-03-33-PM.png[]

* Now open the js-console app by clicking on the icon

image::2020-05-27-18-14-57.png[]

* You should see the following screen. Leave it open as we are going to use it later.

=== Deploy MailHog

* On the left menu, click on `+Add` -> `Container Image`

image::2020-05-27-18-00-20.png[]

Use `mailhog/mailhog` in the `Image name from external registry` field

* Application Name: `redhat-sso`
* Name: `mailhog`

image::5-5-2020-15-06-54-PM.png[]

* Scroll down and click on `Routing` in the advanced options section

image::5-5-2020-15-09-13-PM.png[]

* On `Target Port`, set the field to `8025 -> 8025 (TCP)` and click on `Create`

image::5-5-2020-15-28-04-PM.png[]

=== Grouping js-console and SSO

* While holding down `Shift`, drag the SSO circle near to the js-console

//image::May-27-2020-18-15-58.gif[]
image::Jun-05-2020-11-30-44.gif[]

* Now create a connection between js-console and sso by pulling an arrow from js-console towards sso circle

image::May-27-2020-18-20-04.gif[]

* Repeat the same process to create a connection from `sso` to `mailhog`. You topology should look like this
